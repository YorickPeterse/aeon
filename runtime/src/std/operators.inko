# Traits for the various binary operators.

# The binary `+` operator.
trait Add!(T) {
  # Adds the given object to `self`, producing a new instance of the same type
  # as `self`.
  def +(other: ref T) -> Self
}

# The binary `/` operator.
trait Divide {
  # Divides `self` by the given object, producing a new one of the same type.
  def /(other: ref Self) -> Self
}

# The binary `*` operator.
trait Multiply {
  # Multiplies `self` with the given object, producing a new one of the same
  # type.
  def *(other: ref Self) -> Self
}

# The binary `-` operator.
trait Subtract!(T) {
  # Subtracts the given object from `self`, producing a new instance of the
  # same type as `self`.
  def -(other: ref T) -> Self
}

# The binary `%` operator.
trait Modulo {
  # Gets the remainder after dividing `self` by the given object, producing a
  # new one of the same type.
  def %(other: ref Self) -> Self
}

# The binary `<` operator.
trait Smaller {
  # Returns `True` if `self` is smaller than the given object.
  def <(other: ref Self) -> Boolean
}

# The binary `>` operator.
trait Greater {
  # Returns `True` if `self` is greater than the given object.
  def >(other: ref Self) -> Boolean
}

# The binary `==` operator.
trait Equal {
  # Returns `True` if `self` and the given object are equal to each other.
  #
  # This operator is used to perform structural equality. This means two objects
  # residing in different memory locations may be considered equal, provided
  # their structure is equal. For example, two different Arrays may be
  # considered to have structural equality if they contain the exact same
  # values.
  #
  # The default implementation of this method is to perform referential
  # equality, but objects implementing this trait are free to redefine this
  # method to change this behaviour.
  def ==(other: ref Self) -> Boolean {
    _INKOC.object_equals(self, other)
  }

  # Returns `True` if `self` and the given object are not equal to each other.
  def !=(other: ref Self) -> Boolean {
    _INKOC.object_equals(self == other, False)
  }
}

# The binary `>=` operator.
trait GreaterOrEqual {
  # Returns `True` if `self` is greater than or equal to the given object.
  def >=(other: ref Self) -> Boolean
}

# The binary `<=` operator.
trait SmallerOrEqual {
  # Returns `True` if `self` is smaller than or equal to the given object.
  def <=(other: ref Self) -> Boolean
}

# The binary `&` (bitwise AND) operator.
trait BitwiseAnd {
  # Returns the result of a bitwise AND with `self` and the given object.
  def &(other: ref Self) -> Self
}

# The binary `|` (bitwise OR) operator.
trait BitwiseOr {
  # Returns the result of a bitwise OR with `self` and the given object.
  def |(other: ref Self) -> Self
}

# The binary `^` operator.
trait BitwiseXor {
  # Returns the result of a bitwise XOR with `self` and the given object.
  def ^(other: ref Self) -> Self
}

# The binary `<<` operator.
trait ShiftLeft {
  # Returns the result of a bitwise shift to the left with `self` and the given
  # object.
  def <<(other: ref Self) -> Self
}

# The binary `>>` operator.
trait ShiftRight {
  # Returns the result of a bitwise shift to the right with `self` and the
  # given object.
  def >>(other: ref Self) -> Self
}

# The binary `=~` operator.
#
# This operator is used for pattern matching.
trait Match!(T) {
  # Pattern matches `self` with the given type.
  #
  # If matched successfully, `True` must be returned; otherwise `False` is to be
  # returned.
  def =~(other: ref T) -> Boolean
}
