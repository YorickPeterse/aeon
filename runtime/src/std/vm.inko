# Methods for interacting with the Inko virtual machine.

# Terminates the VM immediately with the given exit status.
#
# The exit status can be a number between -2147483648 and 2147483647.
#
# While calling this method will result in the VM terminating it is technically
# possible another process sets the exit status around the same time. In this
# case the exit status will be set to most recent value.
#
# # Examples
#
# Terminating the VM:
#
#     import std::vm
#
#     vm.exit(1)
def exit(status: Int) -> Never {
  _INKOC.exit(status)
}
